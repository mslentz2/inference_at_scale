In the distant past, Hobbits, like many other folk, migrated westward, with their earliest legends hinting at a time when they lived in the upper vales of Anduin, near Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Their accounts suggest that they crossed the mountains into Eriador due to the increasing presence of Men and the encroaching darkness of Mirkwood. By this time, Hobbits had already diversified into three distinct breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were the most numerous, characterized by their smaller stature and preference for highlands, while the Stoors were broader and favored flat lands. The Fallohides, being the least numerous, were taller and more adventurous, often mingling with Elves and taking on leadership roles among the other Hobbit clans.

As the Hobbits settled in Eriador, they encountered remnants of the Dúnedain, the kings of Men, whose numbers were dwindling. This allowed the Hobbits to establish their own communities, although many of their earlier settlements had been forgotten. They took great pride in their genealogies, meticulously documenting their family trees, which were of great interest to them but often dull to outsiders. At the time the story begins, the Bounders, a group tasked with protecting Hobbit borders from intruders, had increased in number due to reports of strange beings in the area, signaling that something was amiss, though Bilbo, now older, remained unaware of the implications. In the time of Bilbo, the early settlements of Hobbits had faded into obscurity, except for Bree, which remained significant despite its reduced size. It was during these early days that Hobbits adopted the art of writing from the Dúnedain, who had learned it from the Elves, and they transitioned to speaking the Common Speech, known as Westron. They retained a few of their own words and names, marking the beginning of their historical reckoning with the year 1601 of the Third Age, when the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, crossed the Baranduin River into new lands, establishing the Shire.

The Shire was defined by its boundaries and the authority of its Thain, and the Hobbits thrived there, largely ignoring the outside world and its troubles. They had a peaceful existence, with little memory of past conflicts, the last significant battle being the Battle of Greenfields against Orcs. Over time, the Shire became a place of plenty, with rich lands that had once been cultivated, and the Hobbits grew increasingly sheltered from the darker events of Middle-earth.

The Shire was organized into four quarters, known as Farthings, and further divided into folklands. While not all Hobbits were literate, those who were maintained correspondence with friends and relatives beyond their immediate vicinity. The Shire's law enforcement, known as Shirriffs, were more concerned with livestock than with people, reflecting the peaceful nature of Hobbit society.

Bilbo returned to his home at Bag End in his fifty-second year, and life in the Shire continued quietly until he began preparations for his hundred-and-eleventh birthday, marking the start of the significant events that would unfold in the history of the Hobbits. As the Third Age came to a close, the Hobbits' involvement in the larger events of Middle-earth sparked a renewed interest in their own history and traditions. Hobbits had a unique way of dealing with items they no longer needed, referring to them as "mathoms," which they would store in a designated place called the Mathom-house in Michel Delving. Despite their peaceful and easygoing nature, Hobbits possessed a surprising resilience, able to withstand hardships and defend themselves when necessary. They were skilled archers and adept at using stones as weapons, showcasing their ability to handle arms despite their generally non-violent disposition.

Traditionally, Hobbits lived in underground holes, but over time, they adapted to building above ground, especially as their population grew. The wealthier Hobbits maintained luxurious versions of their ancestral burrows, while the poorer ones lived in simple, primitive holes. In the Shire, particularly in older villages like Hobbiton and Tuckborough, many Hobbits constructed houses of wood, brick, or stone, especially those engaged in trades like milling and smithing.

The craft of building was likely influenced by the Dúnedain or learned directly from the Elves, who still inhabited parts of Middle-earth. However, as time passed, Hobbits grew increasingly wary of the Elves and the Sea, which became symbols of fear and death. Their architectural style evolved to favor long, low, and comfortable homes, often imitating their original smials, with a preference for round windows and doors. Hobbit households tended to be large, with many generations living together in ancestral homes, reflecting their clannish nature and meticulous attention to family lineage. Hobbits of old had a remarkable custom of smoking a herb known as pipe-weed, likely a variety of Nicotiana, through clay or wooden pipes. The origins of this practice are shrouded in mystery, but Meriadoc Brandybuck, who later became the Master of Buckland, compiled the available knowledge in his work, Herblore of the Shire. He noted that while the exact time Hobbits began smoking is unknown, they had been using various herbs for ages. The true pipe-weed was first cultivated by Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom around the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning, although the details of how he acquired the plant remain a secret he took to his grave. 

There are claims from Bree-hobbits that they were the first to smoke pipe-weed, asserting that the Shire folk were mere colonists. This claim is considered plausible, as the art of smoking spread from Bree, particularly from the Prancing Pony inn, which has been run by the Butterbur family for generations. Observations suggest that the pipe-weed is not native to the Shire but likely originated from the lower Anduin, possibly brought by the Men of Westernesse, and it grows more abundantly in Gondor than in the North, where it thrives only in warm, sheltered areas like Longbottom. In the Shire, various folklands retained the names of old leading families, though many families, like the Bagginses and Boffins, had moved beyond their original lands. The Tooks predominantly remained in Tookland, while the East and West Marches, including Buckland and the Westmarch, were also part of the Shire. During this period, the Shire lacked a formal government, with families largely managing their own affairs, focusing on agriculture and maintaining a contented, moderate lifestyle. Traditions persisted, including the ancient lore of a high king at Fornost, despite the absence of a king for nearly a millennium. The Hobbits attributed their laws to this ancient king, adhering to what they called The Rules, which were seen as just and timeless.

The Took family held a prominent position, having inherited the title of Thain from the Oldbucks centuries prior. The Thain was responsible for the Shire-moot and the Shire-muster, though these gatherings were rare, rendering the title largely ceremonial. The Tooks were respected for their wealth and the potential for producing strong, adventurous characters, though such traits were often tolerated rather than celebrated. The head of the family was referred to as The Took, often followed by a number to denote lineage.

The only official in the Shire was the Mayor of Michel Delving, elected every seven years during the Free Fair at Mid-summer. The mayor's primary role was to preside over banquets during Shire holidays, with additional responsibilities for the Messenger Service and the Watch, which were the Shire's main services. Bilbo Baggins, having returned from his adventures, retained much of the wealth he had acquired, yet he kept the details of his fortune and the secret of the ring he found hidden from everyone, including his favorite nephew, Frodo. The story of the ring began during his unexpected journey with Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, to reclaim treasure from the dragon Smaug. Their quest was successful, but it was during an encounter with Orcs in the Misty Mountains that Bilbo became lost in the dark mines. There, he stumbled upon a ring that granted invisibility, which he pocketed without understanding its significance.

In the depths of the mines, Bilbo encountered Gollum, a wretched creature who possessed a similar ring, which he called his "Precious." Gollum proposed a riddle game, with Bilbo's life at stake. Bilbo, desperate and lost, accepted the challenge. He ultimately won by asking a question that was not a riddle, which Gollum failed to answer. Despite Gollum's promise to lead him out if he lost, he attempted to betray Bilbo. However, Bilbo, using the ring, escaped Gollum's grasp and fled the mines.

Bilbo later recounted his adventure differently to his companions, claiming Gollum had promised him a gift, which he believed was the ring. This version was recorded in his memoirs, but the truth of the encounter was known to Gandalf, who pressed Bilbo for the real story, causing some strain in their friendship. Despite the tension, Gandalf recognized the importance of the truth regarding the ring.

After his return to the Shire, Bilbo kept the ring a secret, using it occasionally to aid his friends during his adventures. He never spoke of it again, except to Gandalf and Frodo, and he documented his journey, though he kept the ring's existence hidden from the rest of the Shire. He displayed his sword, Sting, and donated his armor to a museum, but the ring remained tucked away in a drawer at Bag End, a secret he believed was safe. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age, the Shire had developed a rich tradition of recording its history, with many families studying ancient legends and events from the Kingdom. Libraries emerged, notably at Undertowers, Great Smials, and Brandy Hall, housing significant historical texts. The Red Book of Westmarch, originally Bilbo's diary, became a crucial source for the history of the War of the Ring, with Frodo adding his accounts upon returning to the Shire. This book, along with volumes gifted by Bilbo, was preserved and copied, leading to various versions, including one created in Gondor at the request of Peregrin's great-grandson. 

The Thain’s Book, a copy of the Red Book, was annotated and corrected in Minas Tirith, containing additional tales and translations from the Elvish. Meriadoc and Peregrin, as heads of their families, contributed to the libraries with works on Eriador and Rohan, while Meriadoc's writings included studies on the Shire's language and calendars. Great Smials focused on broader histories, collecting manuscripts related to Númenor and Sauron, and it was here that The Tale of Years was compiled, drawing on information from Rivendell. The legacy of the Elder Days was preserved through these efforts, even as the last memories of that era faded with the departure of the High-elven folk.
