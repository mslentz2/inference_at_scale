    "In this exercise we looked at how you can use an LLM to extract data from texts. However, this was a very basic form of analysis. There are still other things that can be explored, for example, which employee attribute was the least identifiable or included. With larger data samples, it also becomes increasingly hard for the LLM to extract valuable pieces of infomation.  "
