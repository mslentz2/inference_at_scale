# Introduction 
Welcome to the Inference at Scale Bootcamp!  We are going to be covering how to prepare for running large amounts of data through a large language model to extract, classify and summarize text.  

- This course is about how to perform inference large amounts of data with a combination of Apache Spark (Azure Synapse) and Azure OpenAI
- We are going to focus more on the prompting and accuracy assessments than on the use of Spark.  Apache Spark is a huge topic on its own but using an Azure Service Like Synapse helps you to get going quickly.

# Week 1 - Jan 20th
- About the course
- Talk about the use case and the solution
- Review the Azure Architecture
- Synapse walk through: pipelines, notebooks, linked services, git configuration, spark pools
- Azure OpenAI walk through: Deploying and configuring models
- Scaling Azure OpenAI Model Deployments

# Week 2 - Jan 27th
- Talk about accuracy for Classification and Extraction
- Prompts
- Confusion Matricies

# Week 2 - Feb 3rd
- Talk about accuracy for Summarization
- LLM as Judge pattern
- Putting it all togther: Spark example
